Assignment #6
Due Date: October 26, 2023

*************************************************************************
Remember: Assignments must be turned in electronically (via email). In case 
of a programming assignment, you must be careful about what to turn in. 
If some parts of the assignment are too large, e.g. the output, then you 
only need to print your assignment report and source code. Each assignment 
must have a cover page with your name, assignment number, and due
date. Also, please include the statements of all the problems. A
report which summarizes your solution and results, in the form of a MS
Word document or equivalent, must accompany an assignment submission.

Any questions? Contact Dr. Vasile Rus at vrus@memphis.edu or by phone
at 678-5259.

Problem 1 [40 points]. Automatically collect from memphis.edu 10,000 
unique documents. The documents should be proper after converting them to txt 
(>50 valid tokens after saved as text); only collect .html, .txt, and and .pdf 
web files and then convert them to text - make sure you do not keep any of 
the presentation tags such as html tags. You may use third party tools to 
convert the original files to text. Your output should be a set of 10,000 text 
files (not html, txt, or pdf docs) of at least 50 textual tokens each. You must 
write your own code to collect the documents - DO NOT use an existing crawler.

Store for each proper file the original URL as you will need it later 
when displaying the results to the user.

Problem 2 [20 points]. Preprocess all the files using assignment #4. Save all
preprocessed documents in a single directory which will be the input to
the next assignment, index construction. Send the TA a link to a dropbox 
directory where your preprocessed crawled documents are.
