08/29/23 Welcome to the Information Retrieval and Web Search course.



Welcome!
  The Information Retrieval and Web Search course addresses one of the major problem of our times. Today, one of the major problems is not lack of information but too much information. We need intelligent ways to organize the vast amount of information available at our fingertips and to effectively search for what we want. We are faced with an Information Overload problem. The Information Retrieval and Web Search class presents the major challenges posed by this problem and solutions to these challenges.
  The course introduces computational techniques to search for information in static collections of documents and in dynamic collections, e.g. web. Students will be exposed to text processing algorithms, classical information retrieval models (e.g., Boolean and Vectorial models), and web search techniques. The course is closely related to the Natural Language Processing course.

Assignments: In general, you
get 50% of the grade for correctness and robustness and 50% for
quality of the solution, documentation and style. Assignments should be

 Plagiarism/Cheating Policy:
Plagiarism or cheating behavior in any form is
unethical and detrimental to proper education and will not be
tolerated. All work submitted by student (projects, programming
assignments, lab assignments, quizzes, tests etc.) is expected to be a
student's own work. The plagiarism is incurred when any part of
anybody else's work is passed as your own (no proper credit is listed
to the sources in your own work) so the reader is led to believe it is
therefore your own effort. Students are allowed and encouraged to
discuss with each other and look up resources in the literature
(including the internet) on their assignments, but appropriate
references must be included for the materials consulted, and
appropriate citations made when the material is taken verbatim.


If plagiarism
or cheating occurs, the student will receive a failing grade on the
assignment
and (at the instructor discretion) a failing grade in the course.The
course
instructor may also decide to forward the incident on to University
Judicial
Affairs Office for further disciplinary action.

For further
information on U of M code of student conduct and academic
discipline
procedures, please refer to:  http://www.people.memphis.edu/~jaffairs/.


Tentative
Schedule
You may find
lectures and assignments here! Lectures are compiled from different
sources including personal notes, textbooks, materials
used in related classes on Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing at famous
universities (primarily from UT Austin - Dr. Ray Mooney and UNT - Dr. Rada Mihalcea) and other materials.
